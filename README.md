# JAVASCRIPT Project - Joke Teller

## Description

Joke Teller is an interactive web application designed to bring a touch of humor to your day and help me showcase my knowledge and skills. It fetches jokes from an external API, displays them on the screen, and uses speech synthesis to read them out loud. The application features an animated GIF as a background, adding a playful element to the user experience. It also allows users to filter jokes by category, ensuring that the content is tailored to their preferences. On a button press, the application not only displays a joke but also speaks it out, making it a truly immersive experience.

## Key Features and Technologies Used in the Development of Joke Teller

### Async Function and Fetch API:

Utilizes modern JavaScript features to asynchronously fetch jokes from an external API, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

### Speech Synthesis API:

Leverages the Web Speech API to convert the fetched jokes into spoken words, adding an auditory dimension to the humor.

### Button Press Functionality:

Includes a javascript check to make sure the button is disabled until the end of the joke speech.

Offers a variety of categories for jokes, allowing users to customize their experience by excluding categories they may not enjoy.
